# Envelop for Live (E4L)
Envelop for Live (E4L) is an open source audio production framework for spatial audio composition and performance. Envelop for Live combines Ableton Live as a front end and music production environment with a Max/MSP application as a standalone spatial effects processor and renderer. Envelop for Live is designed to be a highly modular, flexible platform for artists to compose and perform spatial audio, and for developers to create new kinds of audio effects for the Ambisonics domain.

The Envelop for Live server/client system consists of a set of Max For Live devices that communicate via OSC to a spatial processing server running either on the same computer via a Jack Audio Router or on a separate computer. OSC messages are dispatched to the server via a "client" Max patch, which allows a global view of the spatial scene, and facilitates synchronized group processing when needed.

Version 1 of the Envelop for Live system was developed by Rama Gottfried, and is modeled on the architecture of Ircam-Spat combined with an odot port of Alex Harker's "Convolution Reverb Pro" Max For Live device adapted for use with B-Format impulse responses.
